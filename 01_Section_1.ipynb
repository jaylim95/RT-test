        "Quarto includes native support for [Observable JS](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript), a set of enhancements to vanilla JavaScript created by [Mike Bostock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bostock) (also the author of [D3](https://d3js.org/)). Observable JS is distinguished by its [reactive runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime), which is especially well suited for interactive data exploration and analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The creators of Observable JS (Observable, Inc.) run a hosted service at <https://observablehq.com/> where you can create and publish notebooks. Additionally, you can use Observable JS (\"OJS\") in standalone documents and websites via its [core libraries](https://github.com/observablehq). Quarto uses these libraries along with a [compiler](https://github.com/asg017/unofficial-observablehq-compiler/tree/beta) that is run at render time to enable the use of OJS within Quarto documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "OJS works in any Quarto document (plain markdown as well as Jupyter and Knitr documents). Just include your code in an `{ojs}` executable code block. Documents that use OJS need to run on the `http://` or `https://` protocol and not the `file://` protocol. The rest of this article explains the basics of using OJS with Quarto.\n",
